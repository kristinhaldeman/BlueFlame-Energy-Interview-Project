# write a function geteloaddatadf() - you will assign the return value to eloaddf
# in the function do the following
# 1. load the electric load data from elecloaddata.xlsx
# you are not allowed to convert to .csv. Find an appropriate R package that can read .xlsx files and load
# the data in a dataframe called eloaddf. The columns should be dates, kwh, kwVAR
#
# some notes on the data
# the file has 15 min interval data from 1/1/2014 to 12/30/2015
# when you import the data, the first column of your dataset should be dates in POSIXct format
# HINT: use the strptime and as.POSIX.ct functions to form the eloaddf$dates

We now have 3 data sets

1. Electric load data in 15 min interval
2. Weather data in 60 min interval
3. Bill data monthly

Lets do some simple analysis

Display the monthly load profile

```{r}
# display a summary of the electric load data eloaddf$kwh by summarizing it by year, month and total kwh over each month
# your answer should display 24 rows without the header


eloaddf$YearMonth = strftime(eloaddf$dates,format = "%Y-%m")
aggregate(kwh ~ YearMonth, eloaddf, FUN=sum)
```

Now let us do some plotting of the load data

```{r}
# form a dataframe called eloadhrdf with two columns dates, kwh
# this dataframe sums the 15min kwh in the eloaddf to hourly data
# next create a plot frame with two panels side by side
# On the left panel show a heat map of kwh data for 2014 with x-axis as months and y-axis as hour of the day (1 to 24). use subsetting of the data frame rather than copying the data into yet another data frame
# On the right panel show a heat map of kwh data for 2015 with x-axis as months and y-axis as hour of the day (1 to 24). use subsetting of the data frame rather than copying the data into yet another data frame

##normally I would leave eloadhrdf with 4 columns as the aggregate function outputed, one for year, 
##one for month. one for hour, and one for the total kwh for that time interval. This would make it 
##easier to work with and cleaner looking. However, the specifications call for 2 columns only.
##the below code makes it so.  Also, I would create a two dimensional matrix instead to use with one 
##of the many heatmap functions, especially d3heatmap which allows interaction in Rmarkdown

This data shows us pretty much exactly what we would expect from energy usage. The people at this location are active from approximately 8 to midnight. The highest usage is during the summer months, particularly October (from personal experience I know that my electric bill increases by 400% in the summer when I am using the air conidtioning all the time, in particular, last September and October). There are several interesting differences between the two years. For one, 2014 experiences a much more gradual increase in energy usage from April until October, while in 2015, the energy usage was more homogenous throughout the summer months. However, 2015 saw a much higher energy usage throughout October, November, and even December compared to 2014.

We plot the weather data using boxplot to explore the variation in temperature graphically

```{r}
# plot the weather data. Use boxplots in ggplot2 with month on the x-axis and temperature in y-axis
require(ggplot2)

temp = cbind.data.frame(as.numeric(as.character(weatherdf$tempmean)), strftime(weatherdf$dates,format="%m"), strftime(weatherdf$dates,format="%Y"))
names(temp)=c("temp","month","year")
ggplot(na.omit(temp),aes(x=month,y=temp,fill=year)) + geom_boxplot() + labs(x="Month",y="Mean Temperature (F)")
rm(temp)

```
This looks like a typical North American Weather pattern (most likely coastal). Note that we get a small amount of 2013 data, since even though the dates are from 2014, I let Posixct know that the NOAA data's timezone is GMT

We are now ready to build a simple predictive model.

```{r}

# combining selective columns from eloadhrdf and weatherdf

#
# write a simple function called predmodel. the model object should be the return parameter
# pass in the appropriate data frames.
# 
# you should fit a GLM with the following specification kwh ~ month + hrofday + temp
# your model should only use 2014 data for your prediction model
#
# use the summary function and display the results of the function
```

First I wanted to create a scatter plot matrix so I could see how the variables related to one another. This will allow me to determine what kind of model I should expect to be making.

```{r}
cor(modeldatadf[modeldatadf$year==2014,2:5])
pairs(modeldatadf[modeldatadf$year==2014,2:5],main="2014 data")
```

After looking at these, I see that I will probably need to look into polynomial variables in the equations. I also see that there is little correlation in the predictor variables, so I don't have to worry about multicollinearity.

```{r}

predmodel1 <- function() {
  temp1 = glm(kwh ~ temp + month + hour, data=modeldatadf[modeldatadf$year==2014,]) #note that the I() function allows me to use ^ in an R formula
}
predmodel2 <- function() {
  temp2 = glm(kwh ~ temp + month + hour + I(hour^2)+ I(hour^3) + I(hour^4),  data=modeldatadf[modeldatadf$year==2014,]) #note that the I() function allows me to use ^ in an R formula
}

mod1 = predmodel1()
mod2 = predmodel2()

summary(mod1)
summary(mod2)

###lets look at some diagnostics plots
layout(matrix(c(1,2,3,4),2,2))
plot(mod1)
plot(mod2)
par(opar)
```


The residual plots indicate that the errors are approximately normally distributed, but the residuals vs fitted and the leverage plot tell us that there are outliers and heteroscedacity in our model. Using a weighted or robust regression might improve our model. In Model 1, the model for kwh ~ month + hrofday + temp, we see that all variables are significant; month, hour, and temperature all have an effect on the energy used. We see that model 2, which introduces the polynomial terms for hour, also has all of its terms significant. This gives us a lower AIC than for model 1, and indicates a better fitting model.

Lets now compare the predicted model for 2015 with the bill data kwh!

```{r}
#
# run your machine learning model and create a data frame of dates, kwh for 1hr interval data for 2015. note you
# may need to include the last few days of 2014 in your dataset due to the billing dates in January (see billdata.xlsx)
# call your data frame pred2015df.
# now for each of the 12 rows (billing periods) in the billsdf, sum the kwh for the date range in each of the rows from pred2015df for the corresponding start and end of billing in billsdf 
# create a resultsdf which has billdate, predkwh (from pred2015df), actualkwh (from billsdf)
# display the results

pred2015df <- as.data.frame(cbind(predict(gbmFit, newdata=testdata[,2:5]),
                    testdata$month,testdata$hour))
names(pred2015df) = c("kwh.predicted","month","hour")

#adding dates variable
pred2015df$monthchar = ifelse(pred2015df$month<10,paste("0",as.character(pred2015df$month),sep=""),as.character(pred2015df$month))
pred2015df$hourchar = ifelse(pred2015df$hour<10,paste("0",as.character(pred2015df$hour),sep=""),as.character(pred2015df$hour))
   pred2015df$dates = as.POSIXct(strptime(paste(paste( pred2015df$monthchar,"012015",sep=""), paste(pred2015df$hourchar,"00",sep="")),format="%m%d%Y %H%M"))  

   pred2015df = pred2015df[,-c(4:5)]
   
```
   
   
Now create results df. This will be a little complicated since we have month and hour values, but the bill data is for months that do not follow calendar months. Therefore we will assume that each day in a month inherits a fraction of the monthly value. (1/31 for January, 1/28 for February, etc). We can then sum the days as required. For the days in December of 2014, we will use the actual values.

```{r}
monthnums = c(31,28,31,30,31,30,31,31,30,31,30,31) 
   
   pred2015df$daykwh = NA
for (imonth in 1:12) {
  pred2015df[pred2015df$month==imonth,]$daykwh = pred2015df[pred2015df$month==imonth,]$kwh/monthnums[imonth]
}
   
resultsdf <- as.data.frame(matrix(nrow=12,ncol=3))
names(resultsdf) = c("billdate","predkwh","actualkwh")

for (imonth in 1:12) {
  startday = as.numeric(strftime(billdf[imonth,]$billstartdt,format="%d"))
  endday = as.numeric(strftime(billdf[imonth,]$billenddt,format="%d"))
  if (imonth == 1) { #get data from eloaddf for actual numbers
    prevmonth = sum(eloaddf[as.numeric(strftime(eloaddf$dates,format = "%Y")==2014)&
                              as.numeric(strftime(eloaddf$dates,format = "%m")==12)&
                              as.numeric(strftime(eloaddf$dates,format = "%d")>19),]$kwh,
                    na.rm=TRUE)
  } else {
    #multiplying number of days in billing cycle from previous month, with  monthly kwh numbers
    prevmonth = sum(pred2015df[pred2015df$month==(imonth-1),]$daykwh)*((monthnums[imonth-1])-startday+1)
    
    
  }
  
  #multiplying number of days in billing cycle from this month, with  monthly kwh numbers
    thismonth = sum(pred2015df[pred2015df$month==(imonth),]$daykwh)*(endday)
      #putting it all into the df
    resultsdf[imonth,]$billdate = billdf[imonth,]$billdate
    resultsdf[imonth,]$predkwh = prevmonth + thismonth
    resultsdf[imonth,]$actualkwh = billdf[imonth,]$kwh
  
  
}

resultsdf
```
After seeing an order of magnitude difference bewtween the predicted and actual values, I looked into what the problem was. There seems to be some discrepancy in the data since summing kwh for December 20,2014-December 31,3015 coming from the elecload excel file is:
```{r} 
sum(eloaddf[as.numeric(strftime(eloaddf$dates,format = "%Y")==2014)&
                               as.numeric(strftime(eloaddf$dates,format = "%m")==12)&
                               as.numeric(strftime(eloaddf$dates,format = "%d")>19),]$kwh,
                               na.rm=TRUE) 
                    
```
which is already twice as big as the total month for billing cycle from Dec 20 2014 to Jan 28 2015,which came from the billing excel file.:
```{r} 
billdf[1,1:4]
```
I manually validated the numbers that I imported in the dataframes in R with their raw excel files, and there was no discrepancy there. Maybe the two excel sheets are from two different locations? Maybe the units are not the same? Maybe the variable names in billdf are not descriptive enough for me to interpret correctly? I compiled another example of this discrepancy by gathering both sets of data for the December 2015 billing cycle (data from both the electric load and from the billing excel files), into one excel file entitled `December 2015 aggregate billing and electric load data.xlsx1` in order to more easily look at this. 

Therefore,  I will aggregate kwh daily for 2015 from the eloaddf, and compare the results from our model from that. This also makes our job easier by being able to compare calendar months from each dataset. 

```{r} 
eloadmonthdf = aggregate(kwh ~ strftime(eloaddf$dates,format = "%Y") + strftime(eloaddf$dates,format = "%m"),eloaddf,FUN=sum)
names(eloadmonthdf) = c("year","month","kwh")

resultsdf2 <- as.data.frame(matrix(nrow=12,ncol=3))
names(resultsdf2) = c("month","predkwh","actualkwh")

for (imonth in 1:12) {

  #multiplying number of days in billing cycle from this month, with  monthly kwh numbers
    thismonth = sum(pred2015df[pred2015df$month==(imonth),]$kwh)
      #putting it all into the df
    resultsdf2[imonth,]$month= imonth
    resultsdf2[imonth,]$predkwh = thismonth
    resultsdf2[imonth,]$actualkwh = eloadmonthdf[as.numeric(eloadmonthdf$year==2015)&as.numeric(eloadmonthdf$month)==imonth,]$kwh
  
  
}

resultsdf2$error = resultsdf2$predkwh -resultsdf2$actualkwh 
resultsdf2$percenterror = (resultsdf2$predkwh -resultsdf2$actualkwh )/resultsdf2$actualkwh *100

resultsdf2

ggplot(data=resultsdf2,aes(x=month,y=percenterror)) + geom_line(color="red",linetype="dashed") + geom_point(color="red",size=4,shape=21,fill="white") + xlab("Month") + ylab("Percent Error") + ggtitle("Percent Error by Month") + geom_hline(aes(yintercept=0)) + scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(1:12))


```

Conclusions: our model is ok, since there can be more than a 10% difference between the actual and predicted values. Having more years of electric load data would probably help our model a lot. 


This completes this little exploration of energy load data. Thank You!
